shortDesc: My submission to the 2020 GitHub Game Off (ranked 224th of 501 total
  entries), built in 30 days in collaboration with my friend Nick Allen, with
  music by another friend Ridley Tankersley.

  This was a great deal of fun to work on, and such a fruitful learning
  experience. The Game Off is a yearly competition where participants are given
  30 days to create a video game based on a prompt revealed at the start of that
  period. The prompt for this one was “moon shot”, and after a long period of
  workshopping, Nick and I came up with the title for our entry: “Moon Shot”.
  While many features didn’t make the final cut, we were in the end happy with
  what we were able to produce.


  My main goal with this project was to simply finish it—the hard deadline was instrumental in leading us to clarify various aspects of the game that could’ve otherwise languished in abstraction. Doing this with Nick also moved everything along much faster. Beyond the obvious of having another person helping with the technical aspect, having someone to collaborate with on the conceptual side was incredibly helpful. With Ridley’s music coming in in the end, the game very quickly became more than the sum of its parts, and could be the base for future iterations on the idea.
