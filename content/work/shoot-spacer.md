shortDesc: My first game made in Unity outside of some very guided projects
  along with courses. It was also an opportunity to dip my toes in Blender!
  Let's see if I finish it...
description: After going through a few courses on Unity, I set out to build
  something really on my own. Shoot Spacer began as something like an Asteroids
  clone, but has gotten away from that over time. It's really languished in the
  world of "maybe I should change this", but I'm still proud of where it's at
  currently. It was also an excuse to get back into C#, and learn a little bit
  of Blender. I've used the great
  [PSXEffects](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/psxeffects-132368)
  shader assets to go for a low-fi look (unsurprisingly, it's a lot easier to
  pull this off convincingly if you can't do much in terms of modeling!). With
  any luck, I'll turn this into a "complete" game at some point!
