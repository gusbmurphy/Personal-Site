title: What About A Band Called
tags:
  - React

shortDesc: A place to share and rank ideas for band names, and my first real
  full-stack application. This was a lot of fun to put together, and a great
  learning experience.
description: >-
  You'd think that when musicians gather together to talk about their trade,
  they might be talking about their favorite records, sharing chord voicings, or
  talking about vintage equipment. You'd be wrong. They are all sitting around
  saying "what about a band called" followed by a horrible pun. I would know—I
  have a degree in music, and this is the most prized skill of all.


  My objective was to create a place where it could be settled (and unsettled) who has the worst of the puns, the most esoteric of the references, and—thereby—who is the greatest musician. Users are able to sort submitted band names by a few parameters, and can make an account to submit their own, and vote on others'.


  This was my first full-stack web application, written mostly in TypeScript using React, Redux, Express and MongoDB. More specifically, I made some detours to learn about Redux-Saga, the fantastic Redux Toolkit, Enzyme and Sinon in testing (although much of that functionality was eclipsed with TypeScript and typed variations of other libraries), and Mongoose (ultimately Typegoose to take advantage of TypeScript) for interaction with the database.
