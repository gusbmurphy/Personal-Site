description: A simple site for my own self. If you'd like to look at the
  [repository](https://github.com/gusbmurphy/Personal-Site) you can get an idea
  of how much I agonized over the layout with different versions of simple, but
  in the end I think I like it! The background is build with JavaScript using
  the wonderful [Pts.js](https://ptsjs.org/) library, and the real bones of the
  site come from [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). I've also used
  [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) and
  [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) to do some content management.
